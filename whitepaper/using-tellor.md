# Using Tellor

Parties using Tellor simply have to read data from the smart contract. 

It’s very difficult to keep data private on the blockchain.  The on-chain data bank that Tellor’s data providers feed values to is no different.  Therefore, once on-chain, any smart contract can read from these values and utilize the data feed for their own purposes.  However, these parties will not have the ability to influence what data types are updated.  As mentioned earlier, those who wish to have their specific values prioritized must pay enough TRB to bring their request to be one of the top five in the queue.
